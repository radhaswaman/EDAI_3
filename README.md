# Breast Cancer Detection and Prediction Using CNN and Machine Learning

## Overview
This project combines machine learning and deep learning techniques to detect and predict breast cancer. It includes a machine learning pipeline using **Random Forest** for tabular data analysis and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for classifying medical images into three categories: benign, malignant, and normal.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Prepared tabular and image data for analysis and training.
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Used Random Forest for analyzing tabular data to identify significant features and trends.
- **Deep Learning**: Developed a CNN model to classify medical images into benign, malignant, and normal categories.
- **Model Optimization**: Fine-tuned the models to achieve high accuracy in detection and prediction.
- **Interactive Web Application**: Deployed a Streamlit-based web app for real-time predictions, allowing users to upload images or input data for analysis.

## Results
The project demonstrated high accuracy in both detecting and predicting breast cancer, providing a reliable tool for medical image classification and decision-making.
